# Frontend: Assignment 3
The third assignment for the Frontend course at [Changemaker Educations](https://cmeducations.se/utbildningar/program/frontend-app-developer) FEA22 was about JavaScript. Assignment 2 was about creating a small JS game you played using the console, but now it was time to create one that was playable on a site, combining HTML, CSS and JS. I chose to build on the previous assignment, a text based role playing game. 

## What I Used
- JavaScript, for example:
  - Arrays
  - Date Object
  - Event Listeners
  - Functions
  - Ifs
  - Loops
  - Randomization (Math.random)
  - Switch Statements
  - Ternary Expressions
  - Variables
- CSS Prefixing
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- Font Awesome
- Git
- Grid
- Imported Fonts
- Responsive Design

## What I Learned
Assignment 2 was my first real encounter with JavaScript and it felt like a make or break moment. I pushed through and ended up really enjoing my work on that simple console playable game. 

For this assignment I moved the game to a site and expanded on everything. I learned so much working on this project. There are the basics like buttons, event listeners and how to get values from input fields, but also things like reusing and refactoring functions to be as effecient as possible, using arrays (so many arrays!) and naming things in a structured and understandable way. Working on this game was an important part of my web dev journey.
